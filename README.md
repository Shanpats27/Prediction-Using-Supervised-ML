# Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML
Predicting the percentage of a student based on the no. of study hours.

I have created a supervised ML model which takes hours studied by a student as an input and predicts the score.
The data was split into training set and test set. 80% of data was assigned to the training set and 20% to test set
Linear regression algorithm was trained using the training set.
Prediction was made using input of test set and additional new inputs
